# John Belthoff

Software engineer. Primary work in .NET and Angular. Background in professional audio.

## Approach

- **Explicit over implicit** — Abstractions should reduce complexity, not relocate it.
- **Measurement before optimization** — Performance work follows profiling.
- **Security at the boundaries** — Validation and sanitization belong in the architecture.
- **Stability over novelty** — Familiar tools applied correctly beat novel tools applied hastily.

## Current Work

**Ballistics calculator** — .NET application for precision rifle shooters. Stability calculations, ladder test analysis, environmental corrections.

**I Ching Oracle** — Angular SSR frontend, headless WordPress via GraphQL. Content modeling, SEO metadata, server/browser rendering boundaries.

**Poker hand evaluator** — .NET implementation exploring lookup tables and hand ranking algorithms.

## Background

C# and .NET with SQL Server. Docker and NGINX for deployment.

Angular and TypeScript for frontend. SSR concerns: platform detection, hydration correctness, cache layering.

Audio engineering experience in broadcast and live events.
