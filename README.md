### 🎯 About My Work
I design **digital experiences that unite sound, code, and human insight** — from a **cloud-based I Ching oracle for curious minds** to a **high-performance .NET system for real-time analysis**.  

My mission is to help creators and organizations bring ideas to life through **immersive, responsive technology** that fuses **precision engineering** with **expressive design**.

### 🧭 About Me
With decades of experience spanning **professional audio engineering**, **C#/.NET web development**, and **music production**, I thrive on solving technical challenges that demand both logic and artistry.  

I’ve engineered for national television, built cloud-based web apps, and created platforms that merge ancient philosophy with modern technology — all unified by a single principle: **clarity through precision**.
